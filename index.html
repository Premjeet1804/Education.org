          Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims,
          such as transmittin g knowledge or fostering skills and character
          traits. These aims may include the development of understanding,
          rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the
          role of critical thinking in order to distinguish education fr om
          indoctrination. Some theorists require that education results in an
          improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral
          definition of the term. In a slightly different sense, education may
          also refer, not to the pro cess, but to the product of this process:
          the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people.
          Education originated as the transmission of cultural heritage from one
          generation to the next.

          Formal education plays a central role in modern civilization. But in
          primitive cultures, most of the education happens not on the formal
          but on the informal level.[25][37][38] This usually means that there
          is no distinction between activities focused on education and other
          activities. Instead, the whole environment may be seen as a form of
          school and many or all adults may act as teachers. An important reason
          for moving to formal forms of education is due to the sheer quantity
          of knowledge to be passed on, which requires both a formal setting and
          well-trained teachers to be transmitted effectively. A side effect of
          the process of formalization is that the educational experience
          becomes more abstract and more removed from daily life. In this
          regard, more emphasis is put on grasping general patterns instead of
          observing and imitating particular behavior.

          Education designed to support early development in preparation for
          participation in school and society. The programmes are designed for
          children below the age of three. This is ISCED level 01.[56]
          Preschools provide education from ages approximately three to seven,
          depending on the country when children enter primary education. The
          children now readily interact with their peers and the educator.[56]
          These are also known as nursery schools and as kindergarten, except in
          the US, where the term kindergarten refers to the earliest levels of
          primary education.[58] Kindergarten "provides a child-centred,
          preschool curriculum seven-year-old children that aim[s] at unfolding
          the child's physical, intellectual, and moral nature with balanced
          emphasis on each of them.
